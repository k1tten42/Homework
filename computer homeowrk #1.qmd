## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
randomnumbers <- runif(100, min=0, max=2)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
mean(randomnumbers)
```

```{r}
median(randomnumbers)
```

```{r}
veggiebroth <- randomnumbers > 1
```

```{r}
mean(veggiebroth)
```
